Jeff will step you through the first part:

Open the Open Text SOCKS Client
Make sure it is enabled.

Click the edit (in edit this profile) link.

Disable all the proxies.
Add one with the following information:

Name*: Server
Server Address*: 10.250.7.36
Port: 1080
Type: SOCKS 5
DNS Resolution: Resolve Hosts Remotely
Authentication Type*: Blue Coat HTTP

Click the OK, then Save buttons.


Using Chrome, go to https://r.labs.azure.com/virtualmachines

Click the "Sign In" button - use your Progressive email. It should not ask you for a password.

It will probably say you have nothing there - or, maybe something from the Front-End Web Training.

FIRST TIME ONLY - past this url into the same browser window:
https://labs.azure.com/register/par4ttbc

You should now have a VM. Start it.

When it is started, you can hit the connect button (the little computer icon).

Hit ok until you get the Log In.
The password is:
